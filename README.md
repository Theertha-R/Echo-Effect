### Project description:
The project emphasizes on women safety by providing a wearable footwear as safety equipment. On giving continuous 3 taps on the footwear while in danger can give notification alert to the contacts presaved.

### The problem statement:
In 2021, there were over 428,278 reported incidents of women abuse. There lacks a fast accessible mechanism to alert on the necessary personnel which can help in accessing undelayed response which can save many!!

### The solution:
To provide a reliable and affordable access to safety. Smart Footwear is userfriendlywhich is lightweight and portable. Timely actions can result in impactful alerts.
